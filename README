USAGE
======


Given the large number of ACO algorithms, also the number of command
line options is relatively large.

The default parameter settings are such, that MAX-MIN Ant System will
be run using a 3-opt local search, using alpha = 1, beta = 2, rho =
0.5 for a maximum of 10 seconds per each trial for 10 independent
trials. (guess who developed MAX-MIN Ant System ;-)

The executable 'acotsp' provides the following command line options
(given are the short and the long options):

-r, --tries          # number of independent trials
-s, --tours          # number of steps in each trial
-t, --time           # maximum time for each trial 
-i, --tsplibfile     f inputfile (TSPLIB format necessary)
-o, --optimum        # stop if tour better or equal optimum is found
-m, --ants           # number of ants
-g, --nnants         # nearest neighbours in tour construction
-a, --alpha          # alpha (influence of pheromone trails)
-b, --beta           # beta (influence of heuristic information)
-e, --rho            # rho: pheromone trail evaporation
-q, --q0             # q_0: prob. of best choice in tour construction
-k, --nnls           # No. of nearest neighbors for local search
-l, --localsearch    0: no local search   1: 2-opt   2: 2.5-opt   3: 3-opt
-d, --dlb            1 use don't look bits in local search

Options -u --as, -v --eas, -w --ras, -x --mmas, -y --bwas, -z --acs,
-h, --help don't need arguments, while all the others do.  

A Mandatory option is only the option "-i, --tsplibfile". Here, mandatory
means that without specifying this option, the program won't work,
since there is no input file. 

All the other options take some default values. The default values for
these are:

-r, --tries       : 10
-s, --tours       : 100
-t, --time        : 10 /* seconds */
-o, --optimum     : 1
-m, --ants        : 25
-g, --nnants      : 20
-a, --alpha       : 1
-b, --beta        : 2
-e, --rho         : 0.5
-q, --q0          : 0.0
-k, --nnls        : 20
-l, --localsearch : 3 /* use 3-opt */
-d, --dlb         : 1 

The default settings imply that as default MAX-MIN Ant System is run
using a 3-opt local search procedure. Typically, one may want to adjust the parameters

-t, --time
-o, --optimum
-m, --ants
-b, --beta
-e, --rho 
-q, --q0
-l, --localsearch
Example for running an experiment:

./acotsp -i lin318.tsp 

=======
OUTPUT
=======


Every experiment produces three files. These files are 

best.tsplibfilename
cmp.tsplibfilename
stat.tsplibfilename

where tsplibfilename is the instance identifier of the instance under
solution. 

The most important of these is the file "cmp.tsplibfilename". This
file starts with a specification of the parameter settings used to run
the experiment. The section with the comprehensive experimental data
starts with

begin problem tsplibfilename

Next the random number seed for the next trial is given

Then, for each trial statistical information on the development of the
best-so-far solution is given. Each section for a trial starts with

begin try <trial_number>

Then, each time the algorithm finds a new best solution a line 

best <number>	 iteration <number>	 tours <number>	 time <number>

is added, where "best" is the tour length of the best-so-far solution;
iteration is the iteration number in which this solution is found;
tours is the number of solutions constructed so far (typically this is
simple iteration X n_ants); and time is the time at which a new
best-so-far solution is found

Each trial is ended by 

end try <trial_number>

Once all trials are run the line 

end problem tsplibfilename

is added to end the file. 

The file  best.tsplibfilename

collects the information about parameter settings, the best solution
found in each trial, and some additional statistical information.
